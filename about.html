            <div id="myDIV">
                <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                    Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day
                    before
                    Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major
                    parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most
                    elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week,
                    many
                    events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
                    (some
                    of them masquerade balls).

                    The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                    parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of
                    Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super
                    krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion
                    (which is
                    best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus
                    (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
                    Pleasure
                    Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the
                    crowds.
                    The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic
                    "throw
                    cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and
                    route
                    each year.

                    While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                    originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and
                    Canal
                    Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du
                    Vieux
                    and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the
                    weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of
                    the
                    Courts" between Rex and Comus.

            <div id="myDIV1">
                <p>Unknown to the participants and local leaders at the time, the 2020 Carnival season (with parades
                    running from January through Mardi Gras Day on February 25) coincided with increasing spread of
                    coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States as part of a global epidemic. At the
                    time, the disease was actively being dismissed as a major public health threat by President
                    Donald
                    Trump and his administration. As such, federal officials did not advise against the holding of
                    Mardi Gras festivities, scrutiny over large public gatherings had yet to emerge, while scrutiny
                    over
                    international travel primarily placed an emphasis on restricting travel from China—the country
                    from
                    which the disease originated.[13][11] The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana was reported on
                    March
                    9, two weeks after the end of Mardi Gras.

                    Subsequently, the state of Louisiana saw a significant impact from the pandemic, with New
                    Orleans in
                    particular seeing a high rate of cases. Louisiana State University (LSU) associate professor
                    Susanne
                    Straif-Bourgeoi suggested that the rapid spread may have been aided by Mardi Gras
                    festivities.[15][16] Researchers of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette estimated that
                    Louisiana had the fastest growth rate of cases (67.8%, overtaking overtaking New York's 66.1%
                    growth) in the 14 days since its first reported case than any region in the world</p>

            <div id="myDIV2">
                <p>The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold, and purple.
                    The
                    colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
                    inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is
                    unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially
                    selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.[28][29]

                    Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a
                    theory
                    that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and
                    Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely
                    associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was
                    thus
                    avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with
                    the
                    rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to
                    other
                    colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.[28]

                    Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats
                    themed around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in
                    that order symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed
                    as
                    purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though this order violates the rule of tincture.</p>
